As a provided service by Xtream Codes, providers are generally given a custom made Android application in which a special API is used to retrieve different media types. All responses from the API returns a M3U based playlist available for processing.

Media modes
These are the different media modes supported by the Xtream Codes API when obtaining content through the Android API. Do note that the classification of the media is solely the responsibility of the provider and that some content might not be categorized correctly as such.

live: Returns a list of live TV channels. The content returned is using MPEG-TS as a container format.
vod: Returns a list of Video-On-Demand (VOD) content. (This can include movies, sport events, TV shows, etc.) The format is likely to vary depending on the provider itself.
timeshift: Returns a list of prerecorded shows for a given TV channel. The format supported is MPEG-TS.
